        <p>The dataset used is <a target="_blank" href="https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Los-Angeles-International-Airport-Passenger-Traffi/g3qu-7q2u">
            LAX Passenger Counts by Terminal</a>, but the data has been filtered down to show only the total
        passenger counts for arrivals from International flights between the years 2014 and 2017. The choice for
            visualization is a scatter plot, because an attribute like position is effective for showing both
            ordered data, which is the case for the data we're observing.</p>
            <p>The marks are the total passenger counts reported in a given month and year,
            portrayed as points on the scatter plot. The channels are the horizontal position to present
            the categorical attribute of month and year and the vertical position to present the quantitative attribute
            of total passenger count. The color of the points are not meant to represent anything and are only
        orange to stand out from the rest of the plot.</p>
        <p>The plot also has some interactivity.  The mark will be noticeably outlined in black when moused over to help
            users keep track of which mark to learn about more specific information about the mark, such as the year
            and exact number of passengers arriving. This is to help give more detail to the plot since the chart is
            certainly sized down to fit the web page and to also not overwhelm the user with information. Extra
            information should only be visible at the user's request.</p>
        <p>While the scatter plot is a decent way to portray quantified information, users may have difficulty seeing the
        difference between quantities that are very close to each other and also close by date. While the extra information
        on mouseover helps resolve this issue, there are other methods to alleviate this problem. Instead of using dots
        as marks, the scatter plot could be redone into a bar chart so users can better compare the tops of the bar areas.
        Another way could be to enable the mouse to act as the center of a cross-hair that spans the visualization to allow
            not only comparison of nearby marks, but also marks that are not close to each other on the chart.</p>
