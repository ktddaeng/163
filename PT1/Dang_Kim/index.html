        <h1>Project 1: Gender and Mental Health in Tech</h1>

    <div class="divtext">
        <p>The dataset that will be explored in this assignment is from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey">
            Survey on Mental Health in the Tech Workplace in 2014</a>, provided by Open Sourcing Mental Illness, LTD.
            The data obtained comes from a 2014 survey conducted on mental health disorders in the tech workplace. For
            this project, I will explore the role that gender plays into developing a mental health-positive workplace
            in the tech industry.
        </p>

    <h2>Question #1</h2>
    <h3>Are men more or less likely to seek treatment than women?</h3>
    <div id="q1"></div>
    <div id="q1_legend"></div>
    <div class="divtext">
        <p>Let's first examine mental illness and gender. I hypothesize that those who identify as male are not as likely to seek help with one's own mental illnesses in the workplace.
            Because conventional gender roles for men often involve appealing less to one's emotional side, men may not even
        be aware of the symptoms of mental illness. However, women may be less likely to seek help as well, out of worry that
        their need for emotional help can be construed as a weakness at work. Let's see which of the two sides will prevail
        over the other.</p>
        <p>The visualization above is a segmented bar graph depicting gender as one channel, one for if the subject
            identifies as a male, and one if they identify as female. Since survey subjects can
            enter whatever response they choose, we must make sure that we filter the data closely to include various answers
            including that of transgender individuals. A second channel
            is the color of the portions of the two bars as indicated in the legend below the graph, and
            the fraction of the bar that is colored, indicating the ratio of those who did seek help or did not seek help. According
            to the chart, we can observe that the ratio of men seeking help is higher than that of women, which confirms our second
            proposed hypothesis rather than the first. We will use these
            results for a later question.
        </p>

    <h2>Question #2</h2>
    <h3>Which benefits are linked to each other?</h3>
    <div id="q3"></div>
    <p class="p2"><b>(Click and drag!)</b> An undirected graph of various benefits appearing together in a response</p>
    <div class="divtext">
        <p>The most popular mental-health benefit is likely included with other perks, but which are intrinsically linked to each other??
            The following questions are labeled as such in the weighted undirected graph:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Benefits</b> - Does your employer provide mental health benefits?</li>
        <li><b>DiscEmp</b> - Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?</li>
        <li><b>DiscCowkr</b> - Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your coworkers?</li>
        <li><b>DiscSuper</b> - Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor(s)?</li>
        <li><b>MHSerious</b> - Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?</li>
        <li><b>Anon</b> - Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources?</li>
        <li><b>Wellness</b> - Has your employer ever discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program?</li>
        <li><b>Leave</b> - How easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        These questions are the marks, or in this case, nodes, for the undirected graph. Links are drawn between the nodes
        only if there is a significant amount of correlation between each pair of nodes (meaning there is more than 100 matches). This amount
            also defines the thickness of the link, so we can see how strong the link between each question is with the other. Since can be hard
        to read form a static perspective, the graph has been made interactive, so you can click and drag on the nodes. Any stray
        marks will remain in the enclosed space and will not fly away because of gravity.</p>
        <p>
        We see that when a company provides benefits for mental health, other perks such as going on leave, anonymity,
        supervisor support, taking mental health seriously go together often. Yet there is not a strong link between discussing
        with coworkers and company benefits since coworkers are like not obligated to deal with their coworkers' problems.
        Interestingly, there is little correlation between any of the benefits and feeling welcome to talk to one's employer about
        mental health issues. Wellness doesn't seem to hold as strong a weight as the other benefits do, which would mean that
            companies consider mental health services as separate from employee wellness programs.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Question #3</h2>
    <h3>Which states with tech companies are more likely to offer mental health services?</h3>
    <div id="q2"></div>
    <p class="p2">
        Word Clouds of Mental Health-Positive States for Tech Companies
    </p>
    <div class="divtext">
        <p>For our third question, we need some help to narrow down our options to the more popular choices and tech companies in particular.
            I hypothesize that tech companies in metropolitan areas are more likely to be more open-minded, and many companies
            likely try to offer mental health services to compete with the other various companies for future employees. Using
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">Jason Davies' Word Cloud Layout plugin</a>, the visualization above is a
            word cloud of the different states that have tech companies that offer mental health care.
            The larger the state's abbreviation, the higher the number of companies that offer mental health care benefits. To also help categorize
            the size of the words and see which words stand out, large words are colored light blue, medium words are colored grey blue,
            and small words are colored dark purple. A threshold was set to select to highlight any major states that have high amounts
            of mental health positive companies.
        </p>
        <p>Predictably, California ranks first above the other states for since many tech-companies are based in the Silicon Valley
            and Los Angeles. From what I've gathered from various news outlets, the highlighted states are often among the most
            hi-tech states in the country, populated with tech companies. We will use the brightest colored states for our next question.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Question #4</h2>
    <h3>For men and women in tech, which states offer which perks?</h3>
    <div id="q4"></div>
    <p class="p2">A sunburst chart of how many perks received by the two majority genders get in each top-mental-health-positive state</p>
    <div class="divtext">
        <p>For our final question, we would like to know where, if we were a man or woman, should go if we want a job that has a
        mental health positive environment? For this we use a sunburst partition map. We choose the top three or four states that provide health care services from
        Question 3 and then count how many instances we get a "yes" answer like in Question 2, focusing mostly on the perks that are linked the most.
            We also classify by gender, and color and label accordingly. Very small numbers are cut for simplification purposes. In
        addition to displaying all three levels of quantities, we also color each layer in a gradient for easier viewing.</p>
        <p>Overwhelmingly, identifying as male in both California and Oregon most certainly guarantees the most benefits, while
        identifying as female means likely having more perks for mental health in mostly California, but not as much in the other two
            states. Looking back to our results from Question 1, there is
            an implication that women don't have as many perks as men do because they don't seek help.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="divtext">
        <p>
            One of the many issues in the tech industry workplace is gender inequality, and this also includes how mental health
            is handled. As said before, negative gender roles towards women lead female
            workers in tech to undertake stressful conditions and perhaps hiding their condition, unlike men, who do not have
            as much to fear from revealing their mental health issues. This was surprising to me after the first question, because
            it appears that even in an environment where masculinity reigns supreme, men are still able to reach out for help.
            And even though states like California home many tech companies and take a progressive view on
            issues like mental health, women are still somewhat left behind.

        </p>
        <p>But the situation doesn't have to stay this way.</p>
        <p>If more women become involved in the tech industry, perhaps women can be able to contribute more to
            how their company deals with mental health. As seen by California in Question 4, the higher number
            of women correlates with higher number of mental health benefits. Once California sets the precedence to how mental
            health is handled, their practices may likely spill over to other states. If we were to explore this line of questioning more,
            one important factor to consider would be time.
        Analyzing the progression of the increase in mental health benefits for both men and women in all parts of the world
        could give insight to whether my deductions in this conclusion hold true.</p>
