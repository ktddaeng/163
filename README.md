# ECS 163 Project
The following files are the completed projects from my time in Information Interfaces.
## HW 1
This was a warmup project to become familiar with HTML. We chose an existing data visualization we liked online and describe how and our choice was a good visualization. I chose to describe a bubble map from Washington Post on gun violence.
## HW 2
We made a simple visualization in Tableau then replicated the vis with HTML, CSS, D3, and Javascript. We worked with a small dataset of flight patterns from Los Angeles International Airport.
## P1
This project was to tell a story using at least three different kinds of visualization using a given dataset. I made a word cloud, an undirected graph, a bar chart, and a sunburst partition chart to observe the state of mental health in the tech industry along gender lines.
## P2
This project was to create an interface in which at least three different kinds of visualization interact with each other. I used a donut chart, an undirected graph, and an sunburst partition chart to observe the number of food recalls in the past three years. We can filter by meat type and whichever years are observed.
##Final
The final project was worked with a full team of four people. [The full project can be found here](https://github.com/lovick/ecs163-final) but a rough copy exists here. We chose to compile the top 50 most streamed songs on Spotify for each day from 10 major regions. We can see which songs are most successful, which artists are trending during which time. Users can filter down their results by scrubbing along a timeline or select specific artists, regions, or music genres. Streams for each song in a query can be tracked over time in a streamgraph, and the distribution of streams among artists and genres are displayed in a partition sunburst and a treemap, respectively.
